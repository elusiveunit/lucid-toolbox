# Lucid Toolbox

A set of classes used to speed up and automate common tasks.

* `Lucid_Post_Type` for creating custom post types.
* `Lucid_Taxonomy` for creating custom taxonomies.
* `Lucid_Settings` for creating settings pages using the Settings API.
* `Lucid_Contact` for creating contact forms.
* `WPAlchemy_Metabox` for creating metaboxes.

The plugin doesn't do anything by itself, apart from loading language files. It simply allows usage of the classes through something like:

	if ( defined( 'LUCID_TOOLBOX_CLASS' ) && ! class_exists( 'Lucid_Settings' ) )
		require LUCID_TOOLBOX_CLASS . 'lucid-settings.php';

Read more about each class in the included documentation, located in the 'doc' directory.

Lucid Toolbox is currently available in the following languages:

* English
* Swedish
